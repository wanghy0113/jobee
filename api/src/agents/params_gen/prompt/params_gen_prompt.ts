  {{
      "keywords": // List of keywords extracted from the job description used to search for jobs, can be titles, skills, or any other relevant keywords, return empty list if no keyword is found. Up to 5 keywords are allowed.
      "locations": // List of locations extracted from the job description, can be either [city name, state/province name] or [city name, country name if outside the US or Canada], [remote if the job is remote], return empty list if no location is found. Up to 2 locations are allowed.
      "trace_back_days": // Optional number of days to trace back when searching for jobs
